\section{Motivation}
Dialogue systems (e.g. Chat-bots) have made great progress during the last years. Mainly because of the invention of novel neural models ans machine learning techniques. Because of the progress many current research aims to improve the dialogue systems on a individual and human-like level. Recent article \cite[]{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-08149, liu2020impress} tried to tackle this problem by feeding a persona into the network. The network is then trained to extract characteristic information from the given persona in order to generate a human like output sequence.
